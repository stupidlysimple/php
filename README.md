Damn Stupid Simple is a micro framework built for lazy developers. Suitable for those who used to develop vanilla projects, while following today's set of standard. The core is very small in size, yet it contains most of the functions required to rapidly start developing a project. The name itself is obvious.

> New programmers have to take extra effort to learn 
> everything about modern PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symphony. Most 
> of the time were spent on documentations rather than the actual codes.
> This leads to the development of Damn Stupid Simple, as the surface of
> every terminologies, and the entry level to modern day needs. 
> Damn Stupid Simple is hybrid, and it's all you need to start grasping
> modern framework styles. It is everything you need to run from small to large-scale projects.
